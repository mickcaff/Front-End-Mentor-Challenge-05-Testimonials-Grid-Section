## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to better utilise CSS grid areas to make the webpage responsive. 
I utilised three separate breakpoints to change the CSS grid area layout. 

I also used CSS custom variables, which are very useful when changes need to be made to the color scheme. 


### Continued development

- I'm currently learning how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. After this; I will learn React. 
- I am working towards using JavaScript on future FE mentor challenges.
